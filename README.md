# About Me
I am a current Senior at UNC Charlotte majoring in Data Science. I enjoy doing Sports Analytics, analyzing games and modeling metrics. I am looking to continue imporoving my skills and learning new modeling techniques, statistical terminology and apply it to real world situations. On the side I enjoy reading biographies and lifting weights.
